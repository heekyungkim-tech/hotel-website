# hotel-website

I created a hotel website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery.
Website is created with program simulation; randomly assigned number of clients/user is going to randomly pick a hotel amoung the 6 hotels in the website. Each hotel displays it name, total number of rooms, the number of rooms availble, and the number of stars of the pick hotel. <hr/>
1. A load events with a message close is added to this website. <br/> 2. A scroll event is added; when user scroll the webpage down, it should appear an image at the lower-side of the webpage. And when the user click at the image, the webpage should go back to the top of the page. <br/> 3. Each hotel has a link where user can click to book the hotel; On click it has another pop up window where user can input the date of check-in and check-out, the number of rooms and the number of adults, or children for proceeding a hotel reservation.
